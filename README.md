## 15 Puzzle

This project was developed by students taking CS 531 (AI) at Oregon State University. In this assignment, we implemented two memory-bounded heuristic search algorithms, namely IDA* and RBFS, to find the Manhattan distance and Misplaced Tile heuristics to solve the 8-puzzle (view `report.pdf` for full description). Coded in Python3.

Developed by: Christopher Mendez & Rupika Dikkala

## Instructions

Use `python main.py` (if that fails, try `python3 main.py`) to run the code. The output should result performance tables of the A* H1, A* H2, RBFS-H1, RBFS-H2 algorithms. In order to cut down run time, replace `shuffles = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` (line 22, `main.py`) to `shuffles = [10]` (takes an hour to run otherwise).
